1) Traversal through the codebase is difficult:
    - Projects with multiple lanaguages, workspace resets root for neotree
    - project resets neotree root to directories unrelated to the project, for example opening this directory (~/.config/nvim) sets root to ~/.config which is huge

2) Better error highligting
    - Display the main error cause in a sidecandel maner
