## General

Minimalistic as possible, not noise. Configurable is needed.

### Markdown
    - Markdown is rendered dynamically.

### Rust
    - (DONE) Cargo features are fetched dynamically from `.rust-analyzer.json`.

### LSP
    - LSP messages are displayed on the end of the line if possible, otherwise CursorHold can transfer cursor into error buffer.
